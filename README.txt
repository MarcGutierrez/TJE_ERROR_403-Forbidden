The main differences between the GDD and the final version are the type of game, we have change from a dungeon explorer to a survival arena type of game. The are as well some mechanics lacking,
like the different types of boosts, although we have managed to get different types of enemies via randomization.

Controls:
movement: W,A,S,D
shoot: SPACE
