Due to time management and compatibility issues between MacOS and Windows we have not been able to develop the game we aimed to make in the GDD.
We have adapted our ideas to produce a simpler game, yet we still feel the accomplishment of making a replayable fun game with some elements and
ideas reutilized and implemented to itm for example, as we wished to make a procedural make we have had to adapt it from a dungeon explorer to a
survival arena type of game. The are as well some mechanics lacking, like the different types of boosts, although we have managed to get different
types of enemies via randomization. We have not been able to implement any kind of animation to the player or entities, since we wanted to focus on
 making a functional and replayable core concept.

The main mechanic of the game is shooting, and using your mobility and colliding bullets to survive for as long as possible in this wave-based survival shooter.

As can be seen in the following video: https://youtu.be/6G1NbvOAcUs

The mechanics that we find that would best fit the game for future development are:

	- Boss round after a determined number of normal waves
	- Different types of common enemies
	- Powerups that change your cooldowns and projectile types
	- Ricocheting bullets
	- More enemy variety

Controls:
movement: W,A,S,D
shoot: SPACE
